# BlendViz

BlendViz is a tool that allows users to visualize their music through an immersive 3D animated lightshow.

This project uses Demucs by Facebook Research for stem-splitting, and Blender for visualization. The user first chooses a song by either uploading an mp3 file or pasting a Youtube link. They are then allowed to customise the look of their visualizer. The output is a Blender file which can be downloaded. This gives users the freedom to make further modifications to the 3D environment however they deem fit, before the animation is rendered. Please note that **the user must have Blender installed** to be able to open the file.

Use BlendViz via the official [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZDOBFqAzXyAGvg10-hDJlCN9QVqyrlmF?usp=sharing)
